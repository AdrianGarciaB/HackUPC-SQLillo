# HackUPC-SQLillo
## What it does
Our program implements the player logic interface in the SQLillo game, and we have used simple heuristics to carry out this task with good results.

## How we built it
We have programmed the player using the Lua programming language and the pre-implemented SQLillo functions for player information and control such as movements, life information, etc.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We consider that we have achieved a good algorithm since it is efficient and guarantees in most cases to reach the last closures of the circle, as well as having ranked in the top 10 against other algorithms.


## What's next for SQLillo Royale Algorithm
As future work, there is still the task of devising the optimal strategy when the storm circles shrink rapidly. At this point, players are tightly clustered and the algorithm does not achieve good survival rates from this point onwards.
